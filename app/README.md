# What is State?
- Define state as a way to store and manage dynamic data in a React Component

# Why State Matters:
- Drives the User Interface (Toggling a menu, form handling)

# Key Characteristics of State:
- Local to a component
- Can trigger re-render when updated

# Basic Syntax
const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);

# Updating State
- Asynchronous (takes time)
- Updating State with a static value: setState(newValue)
- Updating State depending on the previous value: setState(prevState => prevState + 1)
